# About Argos
_In Greek mythology, Argos, also known as Argus Panoptes, was a giant with a hundred eyes. As a vigilant guardian, he never closed more than half of his eyes at once, ensuring that he was always watching over whatever he was tasked to protect. His watchful nature made him an excellent sentinel, symbolizing vigilance and constant monitoring. The name "Argos" represents our commitment to maintaining continuous oversight of your network, ensuring that no device goes unnoticed._
